 A log manager which triggeres and manages the processing of log items on
 different channels. All items will be immediately passed to the persistence
 layer in order to make the queue crash safe. Once a maximum number of items
 have been enqueued or the internal timer finished running, events will be
 forwarded to the sender. Furthermore, its responsibility is to tell the
 persistence layer what to do with a pending batch based on the status code
 returned by the sender
